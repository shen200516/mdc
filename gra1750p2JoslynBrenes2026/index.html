			<h2>Strawberry Shortcake</h2>
			<p>Japanese Strawberry Shortcake is a beloved, iconic dessert in Japan, characterized by its incredibly light, airy texture and delicate sweetness. Unlike American-style shortcake, which often uses biscuits, the Japanese version is a refined layer cake featuring soft sponge cake, fresh whipped cream, and fresh strawberries. </p>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, salt, honey or corn syrup, vanilla, and water together until it becomes fluffy and a pale yellow color. The batter should form a ribbon when dropped from the whisk.</li>
					<li>The egg whites should be beaten to firm peaks, meaning the tips should fall but the meringue should hold its shape. Over beating the egg whites will result in a lumpy cake.</li>
					<li>Add half of the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture and gently fold it, being careful not to deflate the egg white meringue.</li>
					<li>Next, add the cake flour and baking powder to a fine mesh sieve and sift it into the egg white and egg yolk mixture. Add in the oil by first mixing it with 2 Tablespoons of the mixture and then gently fold in the remaining half of the egg white meringue.</li>
					<li>Bake them at 350 degrees F in parchment lined cake pans until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</li>
					<li>Slice even layers and brush on the sugar syrup on all layers.</li>
					<li>Add the whipped cream then add the strawberry slices on top. Cover the strawberries with another layer of whipped cream and add on a sponge cake layer. Keep repeating until you've used up all your cake layers.</li>
					<li>Frost the top and sides of the cake with whipped cream and decorate with whole strawberries. Dust the top with powdered sugar if desired and serve immediately.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>subcategory of instructions</h4>
				<ol>
				<li>Cake flour - avoid using all purpose flour; cake flour gives this a soft, fluffy texture</li>
					<li>Eggs - I used large eggs which weigh around 60 grams</li>
					<li>Vegetable oil - use a neutral oil such as avocado oil</li>
					<li>Make sure to thoroughly dry the strawberries after washing them. This will help the strawberries stay fresh inside the cake layers.</li>
				</ol>
